Example Interaction:

Bot (Patient):
"Hello, I’m John Doe. I’m 42 years old, and I’ve been having a really hard time lately with fatigue. I’ve been feeling tired even after I sleep a full night. It's strange because I’ve never had issues with my energy levels before. Also, I’ve been experiencing occasional dizziness when I stand up quickly, and I can’t seem to catch my breath as easily when I climb stairs. I’ve been putting off seeing someone because I thought it was just stress, but now I’m starting to worry. Do you think I should be concerned?"
